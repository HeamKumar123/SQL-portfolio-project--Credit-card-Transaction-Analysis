# SQL-portfolio-project--Credit-card-Transactions-Analysis

**Objective**
The main objective of this project is to analyze credit card transaction data to gain insights into customer behavior, detect fraudulent activities, and enhance financial decision-making. This analysis will be conducted by writing and executing SQL queries in SQL Server.

Data Description
The dataset consists of credit card transactions, including the following key attributes:

TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
City: Name of city where transaction ocurred  .
TransactionDate: Date and time of the transaction.
Card Type: Type of Crediti card  (e.g., Gold, Platinum etc.).
Exp_Type: Type of Expenditure (e.g., Bills, Fuel etc.).
Amount: Monetary value of the transaction.


**Key Analysis Areas**

**Customer Behavior Analysis**

Spending Patterns: Analyze average, minimum, and maximum spending per customer.
Transaction Frequency: Identify how often customers make transactions.
Preferred Merchants: Determine which merchants customers frequently visit.
Time-based Analysis: Study spending habits over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).

**Fraud Detection**
Unusual Transaction Amounts: Identify transactions that deviate significantly from a customer's usual spending patterns.
Geographical Anomalies: Detect transactions made in locations far from the customer's typical activity area.
Rapid Succession Transactions: Spot multiple transactions within a short time frame that could indicate fraudulent behavior.

**Merchant Analysis**
Transaction Volume: Evaluate the number of transactions per merchant.
Revenue Generation: Calculate total revenue generated by each merchant.
Customer Preferences: Analyze which merchants are favored by high-spending customers.

**Financial Reporting**
Monthly Summaries: Generate monthly transaction summaries for financial reporting.
Revenue Trends: Identify trends in revenue over time.
Expense Management: Monitor and manage company expenses through detailed transaction reports.

**SQL Queries and Techniques**
To accomplish the analysis, a variety of SQL queries will be employed, including:
Aggregations: Using SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), and COUNT() to calculate total spending, average transaction amounts, and other statistical measures.
Joins: Combining data from multiple tables (e.g., transactions and merchants) using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.
Filtering and Sorting: Using WHERE clauses to filter data and ORDER BY to sort results.
Groupings: Using GROUP BY to segment data based on different attributes such as CustomerID, MerchantID, and TransactionDate.
Window Functions: Applying window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and OVER() for advanced analytical queries.
Subqueries and CTEs: Utilizing subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex queries and better readability.
Stored Procedures and Functions: Creating reusable SQL code blocks for repeated analysis tasks.

**Implementation Steps**

**Data Preparation**
Import and clean the transaction data.
Ensure data integrity and handle missing or inconsistent values.

**Query Development**
Write and test SQL queries to perform the desired analysis.
Optimize queries for performance.

**Conclusion**
This project aims to leverage the power of SQL Server to analyze credit card transaction data comprehensively. By implementing a series of well-structured SQL queries, the project will provide valuable insights into customer behavior, detect potential fraud, and support financial decision-making processes.
